## Answers
This code snippet defines a static class `WebApiConfig` with a `Register` method, which is a standard configuration pattern for ASP.NET Web API. Let's break down what it does:

**Purpose:**

-   **Configuring Web API Routing:** The primary purpose of this code is to set up the default routing for your Web API. Routing determines how incoming HTTP requests are mapped to specific controllers and actions within your API.

**Code Breakdown:**

1.  **`public static class WebApiConfig`:**
    
    -   This declares a static class named `WebApiConfig`. Static classes cannot be instantiated and are used to hold static members, such as utility methods or configuration settings.
    -   In the context of ASP.NET Web API, `WebApiConfig` is a common convention for housing the configuration logic.
2.  **`public static void Register(HttpConfiguration config)`:**
    
    -   This defines a public static method named `Register`, which takes an `HttpConfiguration` object as a parameter.
    -   The `HttpConfiguration` object represents the configuration settings for your Web API.
    -   This method is called during the application startup to register the api routes.
3.  **`config.Routes.MapHttpRoute(...)`:**
    
    -   This is the core of the routing configuration. It calls the `MapHttpRoute` method of the `Routes` property of the `HttpConfiguration` object.
    -   `MapHttpRoute` defines a route template that maps incoming requests to controllers and actions.
4.  **`name: "DefaultApi"`:**
    
    -   This assigns a name to the route, which is "DefaultApi" in this case. The name can be used to refer to the route later, if needed.
5.  **`routeTemplate: "api/{controller}/{id}"`:**
    
    -   This is the route template itself. It specifies the URL pattern that the route will match.
    -   `api/`: This part of the URL is a literal string that must be present in the request URL.
    -   `{controller}`: This is a route parameter that represents the name of the API controller. The Web API framework will look for a controller with this name.
    -   `{id}`: This is another route parameter that represents an identifier, typically used to specify a specific resource.
    -   The curly braces `{}` indicate that these are route parameters.
6.  **`defaults: new { id = RouteParameter.Optional }`:**
    
    -   This specifies default values for route parameters.
    -   `id = RouteParameter.Optional`: This sets the `id` parameter as optional. If the `id` is not present in the URL, the route will still match.
    -   If no default was set, and id was not supplied, the route would not match.

**Example:**

-   If you have a controller named `ProductsController`, the following URLs would match the default route:
    -   `api/Products` (without an `id`)
    -   `api/Products/123` (with `id` 123)

**In Summary:**

This code sets up a simple and common default routing configuration for ASP.NET Web API. It allows your API to handle requests based on the controller name and an optional ID parameter. This allows for RESTful API design.
