## Answers

This C# code snippet defines a `RouteConfig` class with a static method `RegisterRoutes`. This method is crucial in ASP.NET MVC applications for configuring URL routing. Let's break down the code:

**Purpose:**

The purpose of this code is to define how URLs are mapped to specific controllers and actions within your ASP.NET MVC application. This allows users to access different parts of your website by typing in specific URLs.

**Code Breakdown:**

1.  **`public class RouteConfig`**:
    
    -   This declares a public class named `RouteConfig`. This class is typically used to centralize route configuration.
2.  **`public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes)`**:
    
    -   This defines a public static method named `RegisterRoutes`.
    -   `static`: This means the method can be called directly on the `RouteConfig` class without creating an instance.
    -   `void`: This indicates that the method does not return a value.
    -   `RouteCollection routes`: This is the parameter that receives a collection of routes. The ASP.NET MVC framework provides this collection.
3.  **`routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");`**:
    
    -   This line tells the routing engine to ignore URLs that match the pattern `{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}`.
    -   `.axd` files are typically used for internal resources in ASP.NET Web Forms, and this line prevents the MVC routing engine from trying to handle them. This is often present for backwards compatibility reasons, as MVC can be added to web form projects.
4.  **`routes.MapRoute(...)`**:
    
    -   This is the core of the routing configuration. It defines a new route.
    -   `name: "Default"`: This assigns the name "Default" to the route. This name can be used to generate URLs using this route.
    -   `url: "{controller}/{action}/{id}"`: This defines the URL pattern for the route.
        -   `{controller}`: This represents the name of the controller.
        -   `{action}`: This represents the name of the action method within the controller.
        -   `{id}`: This represents an optional parameter named "id".
    -   `defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional }`: This defines the default values for the route parameters.
        -   `controller = "Home"`: If the `controller` parameter is not specified in the URL, it defaults to "Home".
        -   `action = "Index"`: If the `action` parameter is not specified, it defaults to "Index".
        -   `id = UrlParameter.Optional`: If the `id` parameter is not specified, it is considered optional.

**How it Works in ASP.NET MVC:**

-   In an ASP.NET MVC application, the `RegisterRoutes` method is typically called from the `Application_Start` method in the `Global.asax.cs` file.
-   When the application starts, `Application_Start` is executed, which in turn calls `RouteConfig.RegisterRoutes`.
-   The routing engine uses the defined routes to match incoming URLs to specific controllers and actions.
-   For example, if a user enters the URL `/Products/Details/123`, the routing engine will match it to the "Default" route.
    -   `controller` will be "Products".
    -   `action` will be "Details".
    -   `id` will be "123".
-   The routing engine will then invoke the `Details` action method in the `ProductsController`, passing "123" as the `id` parameter.
-   If a user enters just `/`, the default route will take effect. The routing engine will invoke the `Index` action method in the `HomeController`.

**In essence:**

This code defines the default URL routing for your ASP.NET MVC application. It maps URLs to controllers and actions, providing a user-friendly way to navigate your website. It also ignores `.axd` files.
