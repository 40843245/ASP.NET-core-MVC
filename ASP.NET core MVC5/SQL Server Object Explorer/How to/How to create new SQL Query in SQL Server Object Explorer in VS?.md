I ask the Google Gemini with above figure.

Then Google Gemini says:

```
Certainly! Here's a description of the attached file:

The image is a screenshot of an error message dialog box from Microsoft Visual Studio. The dialog box has a light background and a blue title bar with the text "Microsoft Visual Studio". It also includes an "X" button in the upper right corner to close the dialog.

The main content of the dialog box is in Chinese and translates to:

"Cannot access a disposed object.
Object name: 'MarshalingWindowFrame'."

Below the text is a button labeled "OK".

The error message is accompanied by a red circle with a white "X" inside, indicating an error or problem.
```

which indicats the object has been disposed.
